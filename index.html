            it’s a pleasure to find vegetarian food that’s neither fried
            nor boring. <a href="https://www.naturaliebistro.com/" target="_blank" class="naturalie">Naturalie</a> is open only for lunch, and its menu
            (much of it vegan and gluten-free) makes good use of local
            produce like manioc and coconut. Salads come with a bright
            pink beet dressing; there’s a rich stew known as feijoada
            that replaces meat with tofu; and fresh juices are crammed
            with passion fruit, hibiscus and goji berries, and — unlike
            their lunch-counter counterparts — they aren’t full of added
            sugar. It’s carefully considered, unfussy dining that just
            happens to be vegetarian. Lunch for two, around 100 reais,
            or about $26.</p>

            stretches of pristine sand bordering gentle waves. Pick up
            a bathing suit at Blue Man, a decades-old Brazilian brand of
            swimwear that produces eye-catching bikinis, one-pieces and
            briefs in colorful parrot and pineapple patterns (prices
            start around 150 reais). Swing by Osklen, another well-known
            Brazilian brand, which sells elegant T-shirts in linen and
            silk. They recently developed a line of clothing printed with
            images from the work of the pioneering Brazilian artist
            Tarsila do Amaral (an exhibition of her work was at the
            Museum of Modern Art in New York City last year). At <a href="http://www.lojamonicaponde.com.br/" target="_blank" class="monicapondé">Monica Pondé,</a>
            just around the corner, pick up brushed silver
            necklaces with geometric flair (Ms. Mondé, the designer,
            studied architecture), and grab a petit noir coffee from the
            adjacent cafe: the beans are collected from the droppings of
            the jacu, a native bird that ingests only the very ripest
            beans, and the resulting coffee is rich and full-bodied.
            Make a final stop at Toca do Vinicius, a shop for music
            lovers, where all the vintage records and newly released
            CDs are bossa nova and samba.</p>

            off an evening. Packed with an after-work crowd vying for
            seats or standing around small tables, this place is famous
            for its pataniscas: fried balls with chunks of cod and
            slivers of onion, and served with extra-cold beer. If you’re
            feeling brave, try the vodka-coconut mix poured out of a
            Smirnoff bottle — it’s made in-house and is equal parts
            delicious and potent. Then stroll north to Galeto Sat’s,
            a casual spot with just a dozen tables and, behind the bar,
            rows of spring chickens roasting on giant skewers over the
            flames. Start with a basket of the famous garlic bread,
            buttery and liberally doused with garlic bits, add a plate
            of juicy, bite-sized chicken hearts, then round off the meal
            with the roast chicken. Dinner for two, around 120 reais.</p>

            discouraging new customers. The only seats are occupied
            by the musicians and regulars, and the beer — a selection
            of mediocre Brazilian brands and cans of Heineken — is in a
            refrigerator in the back from which you have to help
            yourself. The music, though, is worth twice as much hassle:
            Expect to find a group of eight or so playing and singing
            samba and bossa nova with passion. That passion is shared
            by the onlookers, who dance, sing along (quietly) and snap
            their fingers in applause. The longtime owner, known to
            all as Alfredinho, passed away a few weeks ago, but the
            music plays on.</p>

            (admission, 20 reais) opened with great fanfare in 2015.
            Inside, the exhibits are mostly virtual — hundreds of
            towering screens, some with interactive games, and an
            IMAX-style film — but the content itself focuses more on
            the nature of community, sustainability and disaster-
            forecasting than on futuristic imaginings. The exterior
            and the grounds of the museum are, perhaps, even more
            impressive. Stroll around the water features, admire the
            audacious architecture (it’s been compared to everything
            from a spaceship to a crocodile), and then head to the
            <a href="https://www.museudeartedorio.org.br/" target="_blank" class="museudeartedorio">Museu de Arte do Rio</a> (admission 20 reais) across the plaza.
            This dynamic museum has a frequently changing collection
            of work by mostly Brazilian artists. Make sure to visit the
            roof, from which you can see, across the way, a portrait
            blasted in stone on the side of a neighboring building by
            the Portuguese artist Alexandre Farto, known as Vhils.</p>

            is an integral yet understudied part of the country’s

            with lunch at <a href="https://www.angudogomes.com.br/" target="_blank" class="angudogomez">Angu do Gomes.</a> This restaurant first opened
            in 1955, serving angu, a hearty polenta and meat stew with
            African roots (lunch for two, around 150 reais). From here,
            walk to Valongo Wharf, a Unesco Heritage Site, which was
            the arrival point for almost a million slaves, most from
            West and Central Africa. The wharf itself had been covered
            over and was only rediscovered amid preparations for the
            2016 Olympics. Not far from here is Praça XV. There’s not
            much to be seen now in this huge space except a boat-
            ticketing office and some skateboarders, but it was once
            the site of massive slave auctions. The Instituto de
            Pesquisa e Memória Pretos Novos (open 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.,
            free admission), is a small but sobering museum about the
            slave trade built atop a cemetery — you can still see bones

            morning, the Feira da Glória is one of the city’s best,
            most colorful food markets. Pick up a late breakfast or
            early lunch of tapioca pancakes stuffed with melted ham
            and cheese, a box of sliced pineapple, sugar cane juice or
            sushi, and stroll down the line of stalls whose owners
            loudly advertise their colorful arrays of fresh greens,
            fruit, spices and flowers. At one end there’s pet fish and
            a secondhand market of old clothes, and live music (that
            may include a band of highly skilled drummers) is common.</p>

          <p class=" sunday3p headline">Copacabana might be so famous as to be almost a cliché,
            but it’s still one of the best city beaches in the world.
            Quiosques, or kiosks, dole out draft beer, caipirinhas and
            bags of Globos (crunchy rings made from manioc starch)
            right on the sand, groups of men in tiny swimsuits play
            hands-free volleyball, vendors sell sarongs emblazoned with
            the Brazilian flag, and everyone’s there to have a good time.
            A 10-minute walk south is Arpoador Beach, where you’ll
            often see surfers floating on the water like sea gulls
            waiting to catch the perfect wave. If you’re here around
            sunset, join the groups climbing the rocks at the eastern
            end of the beach for the best views.</p>

          <p class="lodgingp headline">There are plenty of Airbnb options in Rio; a one-bedroom is
            often available for less than $50 a night (depending on the
            season). Botafogo and Flamengo are central neighborhoods positioned
            between the southern beaches and the cultural offerings of the
            northern section of the city.</p>
          <p class="lodgingp headline">The clean, spare Praia Ipanema (doubles start around 490 reais,
            including breakfast) is as close as Rio hotels get to the beach,
            which is just across the road. All rooms have balconies and superior
            rooms have ocean views. The hotel has a beach stand with free chairs
            and towels.</p>
          <p class="lodgingp headline">Halfway between the port area and the South Zone, the funky,
            Philippe Starck-designed Yoo2 (doubles start at 270 reais, including
            breakfast) has a prime location for city exploration. The small
            rooftop pool has great views of the Christ the Redeemer statue in
            one direction and Botafogo beach in the other.</p>
